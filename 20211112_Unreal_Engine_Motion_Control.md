#### Unreal Engine Motion Control Lab Projects
Welcome to "Ramiro's Lab" !!!
###### My name is Ramiro Montes De Oca, and I am a Broadcast Engineer. Member of the SMPTE (Society of Motion Pictures and Television Engineers) and SBE (Society of Broadcast Engineers). 
As System Engineer, I work for the broadcast industry providing new solutions where no other alternative is available. I hack, I make tools... I make it work.
I specialize in hardware design and manufacturing for motion control and interactive tracking systems. 
Unreal Engine is the main tool used for Virtual Production right now. All the programming done for Unreal Engine on this project is Open Source. From codding, electrical engineer, PCB design ... everything is meant to be Open Source.
